## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7, part 1

    One of my favorite labs was lab 7 because it was fascinating to see how we could make functions
    to check if parking was valid on a certain street at a certain time. From this lab,
    I learned how to use command-line arguments to check for parking as well as practicing
    the logical operations(&&, ||, and !) in my code.


* Lab 9, part 1

    Another lab that I found interesting was where we utilized ifstream files.
    It was fun opening the existing file of words, pushing the words into a vector,
    and checking to see if the word was in the dictionary and whether if the word was
    misspelled. The lab was good practice for vectors, strings, and ifstream files.

* Lab 11, part 2

    I liked the object-orietned hilo game that we did recently because it was similar to the lab we did
    previously except we implemented the random number generator. We also coded the
    accessors and constructors in a type class. The game itself was amusing when it generated
    a random number and the user doesn't know what it is.
